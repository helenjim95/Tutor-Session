    // TODO Task 3 Add the method runTask. It returns nothing and has a Task as parameter.
    //  It prints three lines to the command line. You can see them in the problem statement on Artemis.
    //  For this output you need values from the Task given as a parameter. Use its getters to obtain these values.

    //  and finally it tells the tutor to say goodbye.
